<h1>Organized Thinking</h1>
<p>
I have recently come to the realization that I am relatively strong at analyzing situations and generating insights, but I need to work more on how I organize my thoughts in order to communicate effectively. 
“Effective communication” can be broken down into two primary subcategories: writing and speaking. Both of these are skills that can only be improved through practice. Of course, I would like to improve both, but I think it would be more effective if I chose to focus primarily on improving one for 3 (or more) weeks. And so here we are: for the next 3 weeks, I would like to write one article per day communicating some insight or idea. 

The areas I hope to improve are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Organization</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Is your overall argument cohesive and well-thought out?</li>
  <li>Does your argument have a logical framework? (ie do your reasons support/follow one another)</li>
  </ul>
 <li>Readability</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Are you using a fully developed vocabulary?</li>
  <li>Are you using fully developed sentence structure?</li>
  <li>Is the article easy to understand? (does the language flow?)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Engagement</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Do you employ techniques to draw the reader in and invest into what you are talking about?</li>
  <li>Is your stance INTERESTING—that is, does it go beyond the mundane and obvious?</li>
  <li>Does the voice sound like you??</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

My last “goal,” not entirely related to the piece itself, involves time--would I be able to reduce the time it takes for me to produce an effectively communicated piece?

I understand that these categories are rather vague and not fully comprehensive in defining effective writing, but for now I believe it provides an adequate framework for these next three weeks’ experience. Of course, I shall continue to hone my criteria once I have a better understanding of what I am dealing with. 

And so the journey begins!
