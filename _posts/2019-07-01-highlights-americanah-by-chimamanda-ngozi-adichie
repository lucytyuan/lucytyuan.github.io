### by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

My friend [Alex] (alexliu.name) records all the highlights from his readings. You learn a lot by reading through the bits of text that stood out to him. Thought I would share some of my own highlights from this phenomenal book.

Location 1324
> “You know, we live in an ass-licking economy. The biggest problem in this country is not corruption.

## Chapter 11
Location 1980

Location 2548

## Chapter 16

There was something in him, lighter than ego but darker than insecurity, that needed constant buffing, polishing, waxing.

## Chapter 23
Location 3904
> The words came out with the mechanical good cheer of frequent repetition.

Location 3953
> She was a woman who kept to herself and asked no favors, who would not lie, who would not accept even a Christmas card from her students because it might compromise her, who accounted for every single kobo spent on any committee she was on, and here she was, behaving as though truth telling had become a luxury that they could no longer afford.

## Chapter 24
Location 3992
> He was, by turns, inflamed by anger, twisted by confusion, withered by sadness.

Location 4631
> they would not understand the need to escape from the oppressive lethargy of choicelessness. They would not understand why people like him, who were raised well fed and watered but mired in dissatisfaction, conditioned from birth to look towards somewhere else, eternally convinced that real lives happened in that somewhere else, were now resolved to do dangerous things, illegal things, so as to leave, none of them starving, or raped, or from burned villages, but merely hungry for choice and certainty.

## Chapter 31
Location 4816
> There was something wrong with her. She did not know what it was but there was something wrong with her. A hunger, a restlessness. An incomplete knowledge of herself. The sense of something farther away, beyond her reach.

## Chapter 34
Location 5201
> They looked at the world with an impractical, luminous earnestness that moved her, but never convinced her.

## Chapter 35
Location 5306

## Chapter 47
Location 6534

## Chapter 54
Location 7420
> it did not occur to him to doubt himself.

Location 7570
> When Buchi said “Amen!” with that delight, that gusto, Obinze feared she would grow up to be a woman who, with that word “amen,” would squash the questions she wanted to ask of the world.
