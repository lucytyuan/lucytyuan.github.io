I wonder why I felt so aimless last semester. I wonder what I should do differently next year. I really should be confronting the fact that I’ve been using school and work as a distraction. 

I'm forcing myself to peel away my initial fears. NONE OF MY EXCUSES ARE RATIONAL. I'm not inherently worse than others, I just lack practice and careful feedback. I need to stop running away and take action. 

I can’t say I’ve figured out where I’m going with this exactly, but I do know it’s a start. For now, that’s enough.
