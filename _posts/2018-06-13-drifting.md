I wonder why I felt so aimless last semester. I wonder what I should do differently next year. I bounce from thinking about the past, to the future, past, future...But now I'm forcing myself to shove those thoughts back and instead confront the fact that I’ve been using school and work as a distraction. 

I haven't been up to too much lately (spending a lot of time reading and hanging out with my family). This time has lead me to realize that the people that fascinate me the most all have one thing in common: the ability to share insights. They combine thoughtfulness with eloquence to carefully preserve the most poignant and weighty of ideas in a delicate sheath of words. Deep in my core, I wish to be able to write (clearly and expressively!).

The moment this realization hits, my immediate instinct is to pull back. Me! Writer? Definitely not. Acknowledgement of my secret desire goes hand-in-hand with the expectation that I strive to make my dream a reality, and it is so hard for me to believe that I could ever produce a piece that meets any sort of standard. Nonetheless, I'm forcing myself to peel away my initial fears. NONE OF MY EXCUSES ARE RATIONAL. I'm not inherently worse than others, I just lack practice and careful feedback. I need to stop running away and take action. 

I can’t say I’ve figured out where I’m going with this exactly, but I do know it’s a start. For now, that’s enough.
