title: "Organized Thinking"

I have recently come to the realization that I am relatively strong at analyzing situations and generating insights, but I need to work more on how I organize my thoughts in order to communicate effectively. 

“Effective communication” can be broken down into two primary subcategories: writing and speaking. Both of these are skills that can only be improved through practice. Ultimately, I would like to improve both, but I think it would be more effective to just focus on refining one of these for 3 (or more) weeks. Because writing tends to be a more flexible activity than speaking (less pressure, more time to organize), I think focusing on writing would be a good start. Thus, for the next 3 weeks, I would like to write one article per day communicating some insight or idea. 

The areas I hope to improve are as follows:
* **Organization**
  * Is your overall argument cohesive and well-thought out?
  * Does your argument have a logical framework? (ie do your reasons support/follow one another)
* **Readability**
  * Are you using a fully developed vocabulary?
  * Are you using fully developed sentence structure? (Is there reptition? Are there redundant sentences?)
  * Is the article easy to understand? 
* **Engagement**
  * Do you employ techniques to draw the reader in and invest into what you are talking about?
  * Is your stance INTERESTING—that is, does it go beyond the mundane and obvious?
  * Does the voice sound like you??

My last goal, not entirely related to the writing itself, involves time--would I be able to reduce the time it takes for me to produce an effectively communicated piece?

I understand that these categories are rather vague definitions of a "compelling argument", but for now I believe it provides an adequate framework for these next three weeks’ experiment. Of course, I shall continue to hone my criteria once I have a better understanding of what I am dealing with. 

And so the journey begins!
